### RoadMap

* add `mocks` optional using (for independent `api` development, supposedly `connect-api-mocker`)
* add `async`|`await` support
* add `typescript` language supporting



### Aside Libraries Findings

* check for redefining `karma` reporters with command line for `coverage-istanbul` not to run.
