### RoadMap

* update `core-js` [?]
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.4 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.

* add `tslint` for typescript [?]
* add `eslint` for javascript [?]



### Aside Libraries Findings

* check for redefining `karma` reporters with command line for `coverage-istanbul` not to run.
